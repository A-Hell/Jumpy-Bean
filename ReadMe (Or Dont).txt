The HighScore.txt file can be edited manually to change The High Score.


This is My first Python Project (Not mini), Which was made mostly by following Pygame Tutorial By Clear.

I have tried my best to challenge my self by adding some extra features (almost at every stage of the tuorial).

These features include Starting Menu , left and right movement , Death Sound and High Score.

Due to this there might be some slight issues with said features although i have tried my best to identify and eliminate most of them.

An Honest Review will be much appreciated.

Have a fun time playing :D
